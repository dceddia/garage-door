- twilio integration
  - send text message alerts when door state time exceeds thresholds
  - who to send it to? all numbers? one number?
  - allow user to respond with 'close' to close the door
  - maybe allow 'log' to see last few state changes?

- time the garage door, opening and closing. set max times for those states. maybe 1.5x measured time?

{ mongodb maybe:

  - save the log somewhere
  - save the password somewhere
  - allow user to enter a password, and load it from the saved place
  - save sessions?
}
